# LeetCode Training

This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode** problems. It serves as a personal record of the challenges I've completed, as well as a demonstration of my problem-solving skills and familiarity with different algorithms and data structures.

## Structure

Each problem is organized by difficulty level and includes a solution written in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, or **C#**.

### Folder Structure

📁 LeetCode-Training
└── 📂 Technology
├── 📂 Easy
├── 📂 Medium
